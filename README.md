# Image Style Transfer with Node.JS 
Demo of image style transfer app based on Node.js and Express 
that uses [fast neural style transfer](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style) model created and traced with Pytorch.
 
## Usage
Open the site on your mobile or desktop, shoot or upload something, stylize :-)

Live demo: https://nodejs-style-transfer.herokuapp.com

## Why? 
This app is inspired by Lessons 6 & 9 of [Facebook Pytorch Scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship).
It shows how easy it is possible to deploy high-performance ML models these days combining 
such popular platforms as Node.js and NPM with newly released Torch Script feature of Pytorch.

Apart from that, Node.js non-blocking I/O seems to be good fit for running NN inference in Worker Pool.

The heavy lifting of image processing is done by [libtorch C++ library](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/), which is wrapped in Node.js module [libtorchjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libtorchjs) 
 created specially for this app to expose some bits of libtorch in JS.  

## Running
Currently supported platforms are Linux and Windows. libtorch does have Mac variant,
 but it's not included in [libtorchjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libtorchjs) yet.
GPU is also not supported yet.

### Linux or Windows
Checkout repo, install npm libraries, start app: 
```
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```
Open http://localhost:3000/

### Docker
Checkout repo, build image and run: 
```
$ docker build --tag=nodejs-style-transfer .
$ docker run -P nodejs-style-transfer
```
Open http://localhost:3000/

## How to Add Style
This app has just one style included.  
The easiest way to create more models is to install [`fast_neural_style`](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style) from Pytorch examples 
and add following code in the end of `stylyze` function in
[fast_neural_style/neural_style/neural_style.py](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/fast_neural_style/neural_style/neural_style.py#L122): 
```python
traced_script_module = torch.jit.trace(style_model, content_image)
traced_script_module.save("style_model.pt")
```
And after that, execute stylization script on any image and this will write out `style_model.pt`.
Note that traced model will keep the size of your image and will be able to work only with same dimensions.
For this demo app, image size is fairly small (`224x224`) so it's fast even on CPU.

## Disclamer
Note that it's just a toy project and [libtorchjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libtorchjs) is too immature to use in production.
